# Einlandr

Einlandr is a light-weight bootstrapping environment for React apps running on Node servers with Postgres databases.

On the front end it features a clean application architecture utilizing react-redux to manage state with built-in local storage persistence. It comes ready to work with both a REST API and a websocket API, and follows the container/presentational component schema.

On the back end it features a gulp + express server with automatic browser refreshing, hot server code loading, scss, and ES6 support. It is pre-packaged with API authentication shared between REST API and websocket connections, and a clean way to load in environment variables for development and production builds.
